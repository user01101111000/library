The Library project was developed by GROUP M2 "TEAM-TU". The purpose of this project, which is designed with multiple device sizes in mind, along with responsive design, is to enable reading of books online, anywhere and on any device, for those who cannot carry books with them all the time and who do not have time to go to libraries.
